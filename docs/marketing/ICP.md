# Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

## Core ICP: Mystery Box / Unboxing Enthusiasts

**Demographics**: 18–30, male-skewed (70/30), US/UK/Canada/Australia, disposable income $200–800/mo on entertainment and collectibles.

**Psychographics**: Dopamine-seeking, competitive, skeptical of existing platforms after scam scandals. They want the thrill of the pull but are tired of feeling cheated. They binge unboxing content on TikTok and YouTube before buying.

**Current behavior**:
- Have used or researched HypeDrop, Jemlit, Cases.gg, RillaBox, or Drakemall
- Watch unboxing content on TikTok and YouTube before purchasing
- Check Reddit threads like "is [site] legit?" before depositing money
- Compare odds across platforms (when available)
- Spend $50–200/month on mystery boxes or similar chance-based purchases

**Where they hang out**:
- **Reddit**: r/HypeDrop (15k+), r/mysteryboxes, r/Scams (for vetting platforms), r/MysteryBoxReviews
- **TikTok**: #mysterybox (5B+ views), #unboxing (50B+ views), #hypedrop, #mysteryboxopening, #blindbox
- **YouTube**: Unboxing channels — MrBeast, Ryan's World (younger), smaller niche unboxers like TmarTn, anomaly
- **Discord**: HypeDrop Discord, Cases.gg Discord, general unboxing community servers
- **Twitter/X**: Follows @HypeDropcom, @Jemlit, mystery box review accounts

**Buying triggers**:
1. Scarcity — "Only 47 Founder spots left" / "Tier closing soon"
2. Free credits — $25–$200 free credits for early signup is a no-brainer trial
3. Transparent odds — Seeing exact percentages on the vault card resolves the #1 objection
4. Social proof — Watching someone else open a vault and win
5. Playable demo — "Try before you deposit real money" eliminates risk

**Top objections**:

| Objection | Rebuttal |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is this a scam?" | Odds are printed on every vault card. Play the demo for free right now — no account, no deposit. |
| "Is this gambling?" | It's chance-based commerce with real physical items. You always receive a collectible — there's no "lose" outcome. Every vault contains a real item. |
| "Are the items real?" | Every item is a licensed collectible (Funko Pop!, etc.) that you can ship to your door, hold in your digital inventory, or cashout for credits. |
| "What if I get junk?" | Common items are still real collectibles worth 40–85% of the vault price. Plus you can cashout for credits instantly. |
| "How is this different from HypeDrop?" | HypeDrop got hacked for $60M and has hidden odds. We show exact probabilities, stock real collectibles (not crypto), and give you three options for every item: hold, ship, or cashout. |
| "Why should I sign up now?" | Founder tier (first 50 spots) gets $200 in free credits. Once those spots fill, you drop to $100, then $50, then $25. The waitlist is live — spots are going. |

**Voice of customer themes**:
- **Pain**: "Every mystery box site feels rigged" / "I deposited $100 and got garbage" / "They never show the real odds"
- **Desire**: "I just want a fair shot at rare items" / "If I could see the odds I'd actually trust it" / "I want real stuff, not NFTs"
- **Skepticism**: "Prove it's not another HypeDrop" / "Let me try before I pay" / "Show me the odds or I'm out"

## Adjacent ICP 1: Collectible Hobbyists

**Demographics**: 16–35, gender-balanced, US/UK primary. Spend $50–500/mo on collectibles.

**Who they are**: Funko Pop, Youtooz, Sonny Angels, Hot Toys, and trading card collectors who hunt for rare/exclusive items. They already buy blind boxes and mystery bags from retailers. The "chase variant" mechanic is native to them.

**Current behavior**:
- Buy Funko Pop mystery boxes from Amazon, GameStop, Hot Topic
- Hunt for chase variants and store exclusives
- Track collection value on Pop Price Guide, Hobbydb
- Trade in Facebook groups and on Mercari/eBay

**Where they hang out**:
- **Reddit**: r/funkopop (1.1M members), r/youtooz (60k), r/SonnyAngels (40k+), r/ActionFigures (300k), r/ToyCollecting
- **TikTok**: #funkopop (4B+ views), #youtooz, #sonnyangels, #chasefunko, #funkopopcollection, #blindbox
- **Facebook Groups**: "Funko Pop! Collectors" (500k+), "Funko Swap & Sell", "Youtooz Collectors", "Sonny Angels Trade & Sell"
- **Discord**: Funko Discord (official), Youtooz Discord, collector trading servers
- **YouTube**: Top Pops, Pops and Pins, EdsPopsAndToys

**Why VaultedLabs appeals**: Chance to pull rare collectibles at below-retail; the vault mechanic is a premium blind box. Three options (hold/ship/cashout) solve the "I pulled a duplicate" problem that plagues blind box buyers.

**Messaging angle**: "Premium blind boxes with transparent odds — and you can cashout dupes instead of trading on Facebook."

## Adjacent ICP 2: Thrill-Seeking Gamblers / Case Openers

**Demographics**: 18–28, heavily male (85/15), US/EU, spend $100–1,000/mo on gambling-adjacent entertainment.

**Who they are**: CS:GO/CS2 case openers, slots streamers' audiences, sports bettors who enjoy the adrenaline of chance-based outcomes. They want the dopamine hit but may be dissatisfied with digital-only rewards (skins depreciate, withdrawal is complicated).

**Current behavior**:
- Open CS2 cases or use case opening sites (CSGORoll, CSGOEmpire, Gamdom)
- Watch slots content on YouTube/Twitch (Roshtein, TrainwrecksTV, xQc gambling streams)
- Use skin gambling sites or prediction markets
- Spend heavily when on a "hot streak"

**Where they hang out**:
- **Reddit**: r/csgomarketforum (100k), r/GlobalOffensive (2M), r/gambling, r/problemgambling (for awareness — do not target)
- **TikTok**: #csgocases, #caseopening, #slotsonline, #gambling, #bigwin
- **Twitch**: Gambling category, CS2 case opening streams
- **Discord**: CSGORoll Discord, CS2 trading servers, gambling community servers
- **Twitter/X**: Follows gambling streamers, skin trading accounts

**Why VaultedLabs appeals**: Real physical items instead of digital skins. No complicated withdrawal — just ship the item or cashout for credits. The vault opening animation delivers the same dopamine as a case opening but the reward is tangible.

**Messaging angle**: "The case opening thrill, but you get real collectibles instead of pixels."

**Caution**: Messaging must not glorify gambling. Focus on "collectible commerce with chance elements" — not "gambling but better." Avoid targeting anyone under 18 or anyone in gambling recovery communities.

## Exclusion Criteria

Do NOT target these segments:

| Segment | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Crypto / NFT crowd | Wrong product — VaultedLabs sells physical collectibles, not tokens. This audience will expect NFT mechanics, blockchain provenance, and crypto payments. Messaging will confuse them and attract the wrong feedback. |
| Under 18 | Chance-based commerce has age-sensitivity. All messaging, CTAs, and community participation should assume 18+. |
| Bargain hunters seeking guaranteed value | VaultedLabs is chance-based. People who want "$12 for a guaranteed $15 item" will be disappointed. The value prop is the thrill + chance at rare items, not arbitrage. |
| High-roller whales (initially) | At waitlist stage, we can't support $500+ spenders operationally. Focus on $12–$90 vault range customers. |
| International markets with gambling regulations | Some jurisdictions classify mystery boxes as gambling. Stick to US/UK/Canada/Australia for initial launch. |
