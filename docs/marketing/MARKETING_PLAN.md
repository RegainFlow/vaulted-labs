4. **FOUNDER STORY** — Why I built this, industry problems, behind-the-scenes
5. **REACTION CLIPS** — Legendary pulls, surprising results, emotional moments

## Weekly Review Ritual (15 min, every Friday evening)

### Checklist

- [ ] Open PostHog dashboard
- [ ] Record total waitlist signups (current vs target)
- [ ] Calculate weekly velocity (signups this week)
- [ ] Check conversion rate by UTM source: which platform is driving signups?
- [ ] Check play click rate: are people trying the demo?
- [ ] Identify top-performing content (most views, most clicks, most signups)
- [ ] Identify worst-performing content (kill or adjust)
- [ ] Review signup error breakdown (disposable emails? bots? rate limits?)
- [ ] Adjust next week's plan: double down on winners, cut losers
- [ ] Update waitlist counter for next week's scarcity posts

### Decision Framework

| Weekly Velocity | Action                                                                                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| >35/day         | On track. Keep current strategy.                                                                   |
| 20–35/day       | Slightly behind. Increase posting frequency on top channel.                                        |
| 10–20/day       | Behind. Reassess channels. Consider paid boost on best-performing organic content.                 |
| <10/day         | Significantly behind. Pivot strategy — try new channels, new hooks, or consider small paid budget. |

## Go / No-Go Criteria (Day 14)

| Result          | Decision                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 450+ signups    | **GO** — Begin Phase 2 (inventory ops, legal, mobile).                                               |
| 300–449 signups | **CONDITIONAL GO** — Extend sprint by 7 days. If 450 reached by Day 21, proceed.                     |
| 150–299 signups | **REASSESS** — Analyze channel data. Consider pivoting offer, messaging, or adding micro-budget.     |
| <150 signups    | **NO-GO** — Fundamental demand signal is weak. Revisit product/positioning before investing further. |
