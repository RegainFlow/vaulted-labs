## Experiment 1: TikTok Unboxing Screen Record

**ICE Score**: 9 / 8 / 9 = **26**

**Hypothesis**: A 15–30 second screen recording of the vault opening animation with a reaction hook will drive clicks to the waitlist because unboxing content is inherently viral on TikTok (#mysterybox has 5B+ views).

**Channel**: TikTok (organic)

**Steps**:
1. Open the demo at `/play` on mobile or desktop
2. Screen record opening a Bronze vault ($12) — capture the full animation sequence
3. Add a face cam reaction or voiceover (even a simple "wait for it...")
4. Overlay text: "This mystery box shows you the odds BEFORE you open"
5. Cut to the reveal — zoom in on the rarity result
6. End screen: "Link in bio — first 50 get $200 free"
7. Post with hashtags below

**Draft caption**: "POV: a mystery box site that actually shows the odds on the card. This shouldn't be revolutionary but it is. #mysterybox #unboxing #vaultedlabs #odds #transparent"

**Hashtags**: #mysterybox #unboxing #blindbox #funkopop #oddstransparency #vaultedlabs

**UTM**: `?utm_source=tiktok&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch_week1&utm_content=unboxing_v1`

**Success threshold**: >1,000 views and >5 waitlist signups within 48 hours

**ICE Score**: 8 / 7 / 8 = **23**

**Steps**:
1. Write a genuine post: "I compared odds transparency across 6 mystery box sites — here's what I found"
2. Include a comparison table: HypeDrop (no public odds), Jemlit (partial), Cases.gg (no), RillaBox (no), Drakemall (no), VaultedLabs (odds on every card)
3. Include screenshots of the vault cards showing odds
4. Be transparent: "Full disclosure — I'm building VaultedLabs. But the comparison data is real."
5. Link to the playable demo, not the waitlist
6. Engage with every comment for 24 hours

**Draft title**: "I compared odds transparency across 6 mystery box platforms — most don't show anything"

**Draft body**: "I've been deep in the mystery box space and got frustrated that almost no platform shows actual drop rates. So I made a comparison. [table]. The last one (VaultedLabs) is mine — I built it specifically because the odds thing bothered me. You can play the demo here if you want to see how it works: [demo link]. Not asking anyone to sign up — just curious if odds transparency matters to you or if you don't care."

6. Tweet 7: "450 waitlist spots. First 50 get $200 free. Link below."

**Draft hook tweet**: "The mystery box industry does $2B+/year and almost nobody shows the odds. After the HypeDrop $60M hack, I decided to build one that does. Thread on what I found:"

## Experiment 4: TikTok "Odds on Screen" Side-by-Side

**ICE Score**: 8 / 7 / 9 = **24**

**Hypothesis**: A side-by-side comparison of VaultedLabs (odds visible) vs competitor sites (no odds) creates an immediate visual trust signal.

**Channel**: TikTok (organic)

**Steps**:
1. Screen record browsing a competitor site — show that odds are nowhere to be found
2. Screen record VaultedLabs vault cards — zoom in on the probability bars
3. Split screen or quick cut between them
4. Text overlay: "Left: where are the odds? Right: right there."
5. Voiceover or text: "Why is this so hard for other sites?"
