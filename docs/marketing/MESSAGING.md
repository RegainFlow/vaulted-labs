Mystery box sites hide their odds and sell you disappointment — VaultedLabs shows exact probabilities on every vault, stocks real licensed collectibles, and lets you hold, ship, or cashout every item you pull.

## Tone Guide

### Voice Attributes
- **Direct**: No fluff. State facts. Show numbers.
- **Tactical**: Use protocol-style language — "ACCESS GRANTED", "VAULT PROTOCOL", "ODDS VERIFIED"
- **Skeptic-friendly**: Acknowledge the market is full of scams. Don't dodge it — address it head-on.
- **Confident, not hype**: Never use "GUARANTEED RICHES" or "YOU WON'T BELIEVE." Let the product speak.
- **Community-aware**: On Reddit, be helpful first. On TikTok, hook in 3 seconds. On Twitter, be punchy.

### Do
- Use uppercase for labels and headings (VAULT TIER, ODDS, CLAIM)
- Reference specific numbers ($24 Bronze, 1.7% Legendary, $200 Founder credits)
- Invite skepticism ("Don't believe us? Play the demo.")
- Use monospace or code-style formatting when appropriate
- Keep sentences short. Punch hard.

### Don't
- Use gambling language ("bet", "wager", "jackpot", "payout")
- Promise guaranteed returns or ROI
- Use excessive exclamation marks or emoji spam
- Sound corporate or press-release-y
- Compare directly to gambling sites (frame as collectible commerce)

### Platform-Specific Tone

| Platform | Tone Adjustment |
|----------|----------------|
| TikTok | Hook in <3 seconds. Visual-first. Casual voice. "POV: you open a vault and the odds are actually on the screen." |
| Reddit | Value-first. Educational. Answer questions. Never self-promote in title. Comment with context, link only when relevant. |
| Twitter/X | Punchy. Thread-friendly. Hot takes on mystery box industry. Quote-tweet competitor drama. |
| Discord | Community member first. Help people. Share the demo casually. Don't spam join links. |
| Instagram | Visual polish. Reels = TikTok reposts. Stories for scarcity updates ("42 Founder spots left"). |

## Objection Handling Matrix

| # | Objection | Context | Rebuttal |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | "This is gambling." | Reddit comments, DMs | "Every vault contains a real collectible — there's no 'lose' outcome. You're buying a chance-based product with guaranteed item delivery. We show exact odds upfront so you know what you're getting into." |
| 2 | "Is this a scam?" | TikTok comments, Reddit | "Odds are printed on every vault card — not hidden in a TOS page. Play the demo for free right now, no account needed. If it were a scam, we wouldn't let you test it before signing up." |
| 3 | "Are the items real?" | Discord, comments | "Every item is a real, licensed collectible (Funko Pop! etc.). You can ship it to your door, hold it digitally, or cashout for credits. Real products, real shipping, real tracking numbers." |
| 4 | "HypeDrop does the same thing." | Twitter, Reddit | "HypeDrop got hacked for $60M, hides their odds, and sells mostly crypto/digital items. We show odds on every card, stock physical collectibles, and give you three options for every pull." |
| 5 | "What if I always get Common?" | TikTok, Reddit | "Common items are real collectibles worth 40–85% of vault price. Plus you can cashout for credits and try again. But the odds are transparent — a Bronze vault has a 1.7% Legendary chance, and we tell you that before you open." |
| 6 | "Why should I trust a new platform?" | Everywhere | "You shouldn't trust us — you should test us. Demo is live at vaultedlabs.com/play. No account, no deposit. See the odds, open vaults, judge for yourself." |
| 7 | "$24 for a mystery box is expensive." | Reddit, TikTok | "A Funko blind box at Hot Topic is $15 with zero odds shown and no cashout option. A $24 Bronze vault shows you the exact probabilities and lets you cashout if you don't like the pull." |
| 8 | "I'll just wait for launch." | Waitlist objection | "Founder tier ($200 free credits) is first 50 spots only. Once those fill, it drops to $100, then $50, then $25. You can't get Founder pricing after it's gone." |
