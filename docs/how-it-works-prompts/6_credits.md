# 6️⃣ Credits Fuel Everything

## Purpose:
> Closed economic loop visualization.

## Prompt:
Ultra-detailed isometric 3D hard-surface sci-fi render in the VaultedLabs industrial universe. Dark hexagonal sci-fi floor with subtle cyan inset lines and soft reflective surface. Dark gunmetal mechanical construction with glowing cyan circuitry lines and subtle magenta rim lighting. Cinematic high-contrast lighting with subtle volumetric atmosphere. Unreal Engine quality, realistic PBR materials, consistent 3/4 isometric camera angle and depth of field.

A central armored credit core module. Warm golden vault-credit chips flow through illuminated cyan circuitry channels embedded in the platform in a circular loop. Golden energy pulses travel between miniature vault and marketplace modules, visually representing the closed in-game economy cycle.
