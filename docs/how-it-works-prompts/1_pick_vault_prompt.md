## Prompt:
Ultra-detailed isometric 3D hard-surface sci-fi render in the VaultedLabs industrial universe. Dark hexagonal sci-fi floor with subtle cyan inset lines and soft reflective surface. Dark gunmetal mechanical construction with glowing cyan circuitry lines and subtle magenta rim lighting. Cinematic high-contrast lighting with subtle volumetric atmosphere. Unreal Engine quality, realistic PBR materials, consistent 3/4 isometric camera angle and depth of field.

Six futuristic armored vault doors aligned in a row. Each vault shares the same industrial chassis but features a distinct central door material: rugged brushed bronze with exposed gears, mirror-polished silver alloy, radiant metallic gold with etched glowing circuitry, matte platinum steel with precision seams, deep black obsidian crystal with magenta fracture veins, and highly refractive faceted diamond composite with realistic light dispersion.
